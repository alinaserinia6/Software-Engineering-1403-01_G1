# Chat microservice

This project focuses on the design and development of a two-person chat system tailored for language learners. Its primary goal is to create an interactive platform that allows users to enhance their language skills through both written and voice messages. The system is inspired by real-world scenarios and is based on the actual needs of learners, aiming to foster greater interaction and collaboration between users.

In addition to the core features, the platform includes the creation of chat groups to encourage more dynamic interactions. This feature enhances communication efficiency, allowing users to connect in a more meaningful way.

The system's design emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, with intuitive user interfaces that make the platform accessible to all users. By adopting a microservices architecture, the platform ensures faster onboarding and reduces the time required for users to become familiar with the chat system.

Security and privacy are paramount in any messaging service, and this project prioritizes protecting users' conversations. Additionally, the system provides access to chat history, ensuring that messages are not lost or deleted, which could otherwise hinder interaction and engagement.
